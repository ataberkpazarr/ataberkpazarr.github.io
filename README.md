## [Project 2: CubeSurfer 3D](https://github.com/ataberkpazarr/CubeSurfer3D)

 CubeSurfer3D is famous game of Voodoo Studio’s. It is avaliable for both Android 
and IOS. I had tried to make clone of it.  I only implemented 3 levels. For the sake of development, it is not in 9:16 
resolutions, it is in 16:9 resolutions, that’s why the below screenshots are seems wide. In the game, the main 
player may collect the red cubes, and increase its size, may take from coin and increase its stored coin(right up 
corner), may collide an obstacle and it can lose size with respected to collided object’s size, and also we are 
able to see the way that player took in the above of screen (180).
